# TherapyJournal

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication (Google and email/password).
- Invite Therapist: User can invite a therapist to their journal system with a unique secret code (f.ex 183758) and add the therapist name to the invite (f.ex Marte). The therapist can then go on a link on the web app and login to their patient journal system, read and comment on their entries.
- Dashboard Layout: Set up a basic dashboard layout with a side menu using Reka UI components. Include a placeholder for journal entries.
- Journal Entry Editor: Create a basic journal entry editor with text formatting options. Journal entries are encrypted in the Firestore database for privacy reasons. User can manually add custom sentiment sliders and tags on their journal entries. (f.ex Sad 0 - 10 and slide to 7, Grateful 0 - 10 and slide to 3)
- Journal Entry Display: Display saved journal entries in a list or calendar format. Enable users to view and filter entries by date or keywords.
- Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate sentiment analysis to detect the emotional tone of each journal entry and suggest tools for reflection.
- Language options: English and Norwegian. (With option to add more languages in the development phase)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#42A5F5) to promote relaxation.
- Secondary color: Soft gray (#E0E0E0) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clear and readable sans-serif fonts for body text.
- Simple and consistent icons for navigation and actions.
- Clean and organized layout with ample white space for a distraction-free experience.
- Subtle animations for transitions and feedback.

## Original User Request:
You're experienced web application engineer specialised in Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Firebase Ecosystem (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting), Pinia and the latest Reka UI for Nuxt applications.

I want to create an journal system for therapy.
User can login with their Google account (Firebase authentication) or signup with their email/password.
Then the user is directed to the journal system.
Lets start by creating a boilerplate for the website, with a side menu on the left with a dashboard.
The project structure should be modular, I want to add in new features in the development.
